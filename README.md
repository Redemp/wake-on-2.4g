# wake-on-2.4g

A Bash script to safely suspend and resume Linux systems (such as Batocera) while keeping selected 2.4GHz USB dongles (e.g., wireless controllers, keyboards, mice) functional across suspend cycles.

## 🎯 Purpose

Many 2.4GHz USB dongles can unintentionally wake the system immediately after it's suspended — even without user input — due to poor firmware support or improper USB wakeup handling. This script safely manages only *known* devices listed in `dongles.conf` to control their wake behavior. It ensures these dongles are unbound before suspend and rebound after resume, and selectively enables USB wakeup (`power/wakeup`) **only** for devices that should allow wake functionality.

This helps prevent unwanted wake-ups while preserving proper functionality of your gamepad dongles.

## ✅ Features

- Suspend-safe handling for known 2.4GHz USB dongles
- **Mandatory**: Force-enables USB wakeup (`power/wakeup`) for selected USB devices listed in `dongles.conf`
- Uses a config file to define which dongles to unbind/rebind during suspend
- Compatible with Batocera, but works on most Linux distributions
- Includes a `force_usb_wakeup_dongles` service that integrates with Batocera
- Debug-friendly output with logging support
- Ensures safe driver rebinding using kernel paths

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Instead of copying files manually, you can now use the included install script to set everything up automatically.

### ▶️ How to use:

```bash
chmod +x ./Install.sh
./Install.sh
```

### 🧰 What it does:

- Installs `register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh` to `/userdata/system/dongle_2_4g/`
- Installs `00-dongle-safe-suspend.sh` to Batocera’s suspend scripts folder
- Installs `force_usb_wakeup_dongles` to `/usr/share/batocera/services/`
- Copies `dongles.conf` to `/userdata/system/configs/` if it doesn't already exist
- Saves all changes using `batocera-save-overlay`

---

## 📁 File Structure

These files will be installed automatically by `Install.sh`, or can be copied manually:

- `/userdata/system/dongle_2_4g/register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh`        ← Interactive dongle setup tool
- `/usr/share/batocera/services/force_usb_wakeup_dongles`         ← System-wide USB wakeup handler
- `/userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/scripts/suspend/00-dongle-safe-suspend.sh`
- `/userdata/system/configs/dongles.conf`

---

## 🛠️ Usage (Manual setup)

1. **Copy all files** to their respective paths listed above.

2. **Make sure the scripts and config are executable**:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/share/batocera/services/force_usb_wakeup_dongles
chmod +x /userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/scripts/suspend/00-dongle-safe-suspend.sh
chmod +x /userdata/system/dongle_2_4g/register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh
```

3. **Enable the force_usb_wakeup_dongles service in EmulationStation**:

- Go to Main Menu → System Settings
- Under the Advanced tab, go to Services
- Enable: `force_usb_wakeup_dongles`

4. (Optional) Test the suspend script manually:

```bash
bash -xv /userdata/system/configs/emulationstation/scripts/suspend/00-dongle-safe-suspend.sh
```

5. Save the system overlay so that all changes persist across reboots:

```bash
batocera-save-overlay
```

## 🔌 `register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh`

This interactive script helps you register a 2.4GHz gamepad dongle for suspend-safe wake-up support. It detects the dongle in both its **disconnected (idle)** and **connected (paired)** states, and automatically generates the necessary configuration and udev rule files.

### 🧰 What it does:

1. Asks the user to unplug all 2.4GHz dongles.
2. Prompts to connect only the dongle to register (direct USB port).
3. Captures the dongle's USB info in idle state.
4. Asks the user to pair the controller with the dongle.
5. Captures the USB info again in connected state.
6. Creates a structured JSON export with both states for reference.
7. Appends a matching line to `dongles.conf` (with optional `:waitdock`).
8. Generates a matching udev rule for proper wake-up behavior.
9. Prevents duplicate entries and names all files consistently.

### 📦 Output:

- JSON file: `./dongles/<vendor>_<product>_usb_2.4ghz_dongle_<timestamp>.json`
- Config entry: added to:  
  `/userdata/system/configs/dongles.conf`
- Udev rule:  
  `/etc/udev/rules.d/30-wake-on-<dongle-name>.rules`

### ▶️ How to use:

```bash
chmod +x /userdata/system/dongle_2_4g/register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh
/userdata/system/dongle_2_4g/register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh
```

> 🛡️ This ensures that Batocera can safely suspend and resume **only when your gamepad is docked and ready**, preventing unwanted wake-ups from idle dongles or false signals.

## 🔧 Example `dongles.conf`

This configuration file controls which dongles are managed during suspend/resume. It is auto-generated by `register_2.4ghz_dongle.sh` and uses the extended format shown below.

- All entries now include `:waitdock` to suspend only when the controller is docked (connected).
- The `:idle=XXXX` tag helps distinguish idle/active states.
- `:timeout=15` defines how long to wait (in seconds) for docking detection.
- Each entry is clearly commented with a human-readable device name.

**Format:**

```
VENDOR_ID:PRODUCT_ID:SERIAL:waitdock:idle=IDLE_PRODUCT_ID:timeout=SECONDS
```

**Examples:**

```
# DEVICE
2dc8:3106:E417D81715AD:waitdock:idle=3109:timeout=15    # 8BitDo_2dc8_3109_E417D81715AD_usb_2.4ghz_dongle
# DEVICE
2dc8:3106:E417D8AB4398:waitdock:idle=3109:timeout=15    # 8BitDo_2dc8_3109_E417D8AB4398_usb_2.4ghz_dongle
# DEVICE
045e:028e:GH-SP-5027-1 H2:waitdock:idle=0011:timeout=15    # SWITCHCOLTD_0079_0011_GH-SP-5027-1 H2_usb_2.4ghz_dongle
```

> 💡 These entries are created automatically by the registration script and do not need manual editing in most cases.
